# Top 100 English Words in **VERBUM**

We will use the _Top 100 English Words_ to establish a baseline from which to practice **Verbum** sentences and language rules. Speaking of the language rules, we will immeidately see with the Top 100 Words that we will hit a common **Verbum** rule which is when a morpheme is used as a stand-alone word, that morpheme is paired with the It/Thing Pronoun in the proper affix position to represent the morpheme meaning as a word.  So one of the first examples of this is the word _TO_. To in **Verbum** is referred to as a _Locative/Motion_ morpheme, meaning it represents motion towards something.  This is also true for Locative words like _IN_, which is also in the list.  These _Locative/Motion_ Morphemes are normally attached to the word they are affecting.  But if they are to be used individually or outside of a _Locative/Motion_ situation then the rule above is used.
